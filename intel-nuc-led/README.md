# Intel NUC7i[x]BN and NUC6CAY LED Control

This is a simple kernel module to control the power and ring LEDs on Intel NUC7i[x]BN and NUC6CAY kits.

This module is intended as a demonstration/proof-of-concept and may not be maintained further.  Perhaps
it can act as a jumping off point for a more polished and complete implementation.  For testing and basic
manipulation of the power LED and ring LED, it ought to work fine, but use with caution none the less. This
has only been tested on 4.4.x kernels.

Requirements:

* Intel NUC7i[x]BN and NUC6CAY
* BIOS AY0038 or BN0043 or later
* ACPI/WMI support in kernel
* LED(s) set to SW Control in BIOS
    
This driver works via '/proc/acpi/nuc_led'.  To get current LED state:

    cat /proc/acpi/nuc_led
    
To change the LED state:

    echo '<led>,<brightness>,<blink/fade>,<color>' | sudo tee /proc/acpi/nuc_led > /dev/null
    
LEDs:

* power - the power button LED
* ring  - the ring LED surrounding the front panel
    
Brightness:

* any integer between 0 and 100

Blink/fade:

* none          solid/always on
* blink_slow    0.25Hz blink
* blink_medium  0.5Hz blink
* blink_fast    1Hz blink
* fade_slow     0.25Hz blink
* fade_medium   0.5Hz blink
* fade_fast     1Hz blink
    
Color (power LED):

* off
* blue
* amber
    
Color (ring LED):

* off
* cyan
* pink
* yellow
* blue
* red
* green
* white
    
Example execution to cause the ring LED blink green at a medium rate at partial intensity:

    echo 'ring,80,blink_medium,green' | sudo tee /proc/acpi/nuc_led > /dev/null
    
Errors in passing parameters will appear as warnings in dmesg.

You can change the owner, group and permissions of `/proc/acpi/nuc_led` by passing parameters to the nuc_led kernel module. Use:

* `nuc_led_uid` to set the owner (default is 0, root)
* `nuc_led_gid` to set the owning group (default is 0, root)
* `nuc_led_perms` to set the file permissions (default is r+w for group and user and r for others)
